Sony introduces the first 3½-inch floppy drives and diskettes in 1981. The first significant company to adopt the 3½-inch floppy for general use was Hewlett-Packard in 1982, an event which was critical in establishing momentum for the format and which helped it prevail over the other contenders for the microfloppy standard, including 3-inch, 3¼-inch, and 3.9-inch formats.
