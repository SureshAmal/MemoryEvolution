IBM 726 dual tape drive

Magnetic tape allows for inexpensive mass storage of information and is a key part of the computer revolution. The IBM 726 was an early and important practical high-speed magnetic tape system for electronic computers. Announced on May 21, 1952, the system used a unique 'vacuum channel' method of keeping a loop of tape circulating between two points, allowing the tape drive to start and stop the tape in a split-second. The Model 726 was initially sold in 1953 with IBM's first electronic digital computer, the Model 701, and could store 2 million digits per tapeâ€”an enormous amount at the time. The 726 rented for $850 a month.
