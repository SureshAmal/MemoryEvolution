The ILLIAC IV supercomputer is delivered to NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California. One Fairchild-built Processing Element Memory (PEM), which stores 16,834 bytes, was in each of ILLIAC IV's 64 processors. The 131,072-bit PEM was built by Fairchild using their new 256-bit bipolar SRAM chips. This was the first commercial use of commodity semiconductor memory in a large computer system.

### Intel 1103 Memory Chip

The introduction of the 1 KB Intel 1103 memory chip marks both the beginning of the end for the use of magnetic core in computers -- in use since the mid-1950s -- and the start of the semiconductor dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) integrated circuit memory. The 1103 sold slowly at first, but this likely helped the development team at Intel, which was still ironing out details about the chip's specifications after its initial release. However, at a price of 1Â¢ per bit and with a speed compatible with existing logic circuits, sales soon skyrocketed.
