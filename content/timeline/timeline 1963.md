DECtape is introduced. It was a modification of DEC's earlier LINCtape, and as a reliable and inexpensive storage medium was used in several generations of DEC minicomputers. The Â¾-inch tape was widely thought to be an improvement over paper tape and part of its reliability stemmed from the fact that it was laminated and the magnetic part of the tape was sandwiched between two layers of mylar. DECtape was often used as a form of personal data storage, as the small reels could be easily hand-carried.
